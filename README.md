# Integration Project - Jojo Trivia Game
This program will create a fun and quick trivia game centered around Jojo's Bizzare Adventures. 
When the program is run the game will show up as a pop up window with graphics, the user will then insert their answers into input boxes. 
From there, the program checks if the answer is correct and calculates the final score. The program imports the grahics.py library to incoroporate pop-up grahics. The program that incorporates graphics is a fun game for JOJO nerds and enthusiasts is called JOJO-trivia game.py

**Goals (high level intended outcomes; for software, a Product Backlog)**  
- To get an introduction into computer graphics 
- To develop a trvia game using the basics of GUI development
 
**Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do)**  
- Present Questions to the player through a GUI window
- Take in answers from the player
- Determine if player is correct
- Calculate final score

**Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)**  
- Application will correctly determine if player is correct
- Application will accuratley calculate final score

**Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process** used to develop or modify a system)  
- graphics.py library has limited capability
