# Integration Project - Jojo Trivia Game
This program will create a fun and quick trivia game centered around Jojo's Bizzare Adventures. 
When the program is run the game will show up as a pop up window with graphics, the user will then insert their answers into input boxes. 
From there, the program checks if the answer is correct and calculates the final score. The program imports the grahics.py library to incoroporate pop-up grahics. The program that incorporates graphics is a fun game for JOJO nerds and enthusiasts is called JOJO-trivia game.py
